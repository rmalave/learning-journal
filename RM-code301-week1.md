This week I worked on a lot of css and jquery. I also got introduced to some ES6 syntax and variable names. This week has been pretty simple so far, but new things have been learned.

I am looking forward to learning more ES6 and functional programing techniques. Since I discovered the functional programing approach to coding I have been having fun reading and discovering more about the topic.
