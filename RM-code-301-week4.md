This week we touched on some more sql queries with joins. https://sqlbolt.com/ is a greate resource to learn sql syntax with useful realtime exercises. 

We also learned about higher order functions, http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html is a greate resource for getting started with them.
