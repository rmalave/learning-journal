# Journal Entry

This week we touched on more ajax with jquery and learning routes with page.js. We did some CSS practice with a UI challenge to use sprites on checkboxes, radio buttons and select elements by displaying a different part of an image depending on state.

We did some deployment practice with heroku while building an api application and a front end application.
